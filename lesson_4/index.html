				<p>
					React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3][4] for
					building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of
					individual developers and companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
					Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React
					applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.

				<p>
					React code is made of entities called components.These components are modular and
					reusable.React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are
					rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, values are
					passed between components through props (short for "properties"). Values internal to a component are called
					its state.
				</p>
				<p>
					The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class
					components.

					On February 16, 2019, <span>React 16.8</span> was released to the public, introducing React Hooks.[14] Hooks
					are functions
					that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.[15] Notably,
					Hooks do not work inside classes — they let developers use more features of React without classes.[16]
				</p>
				<p>
					React provides several built-in Hooks such as useState, useContext, useReducer,
					useMemo and useEffect.[19][13]: Others are documented in the Hooks API
					Reference. useState and useEffect, which are the most commonly used, are for controlling
					state and side effects[10]:respectively.

				<p>
					React server components or "RSC"s re function components that run exclusively on the server. The concept
					was first introduced in the talk <span>Data Fetching</span> with Server Components Though a similar concept to
					Server Side
					Rendering, RSCs do not send corresponding JavaScript to the client as no hydration occurs. As a result, they
					have no access to hooks. However, they may be asynchronous function, allowing them to directly perform
					asynchronous operations:

			<div class="class-components__text">
				<p>
					Class components are declared using ES6 classes. They behave the same way that function components do, but
					instead of using Hooks to manage state and lifecycle events, they use the lifecycle methods on the
					React.Component base class.
				</p>
				<p>
					The introduction of React Hooks with React 16.8 in February 2019 allowed developers to manage state and
					lifecycle behaviors within functional components, reducing the reliance on class components.
				</p>
				<p>
					React Hooks, such as useState for state management and useEffect for side effects, have provided a more
					streamlined and concise way to build and manage React applications. This shift has led to improved code
					readability and reusability, encouraging developers to migrate from class components to functional components.
				</p>
				<p>
					This trend aligns with the broader industry movement towards functional programming and modular design. As
					React continues to evolve, it's essential for developers to consider the benefits of functional components and
					React Hooks when building new applications or refactoring existing ones.
